**Project Type:** Cool the overworked Sonos amp  
**Role:** Product Designer, Engineer  
**Skills:** AutoCAD

## Background & Problem
User has several Sonos amps inside a utility closet in their house with poor ventilation. After hours of usage of their home theater system, Sonos amps drop audio levels and perform poorly.

**Goal:** Design and provide a cooling system that will cool the Sonos Amps in the same location and maintain their functionality after hours of usage.

## Research & Discovery
Research found that the community’s most common solution was to place PC fans on top of the Sonos Amp. No official or aftermarket 3D-printable solutions existed.

## Solution Design
- Started with rough hand sketches before moving the concept into Fusion360.  
- The design needed to be **stackable** for multiple Sonos amps.  
- Concept included **two modular pieces**:  
  1. **Bottom module:** Intakes cool air and cools the bottom of the amp, starting a “wind tunnel” effect.  
  2. **Top module:** Exhausts hot air from the amp below and removes accumulated heat from the amp above.

## Testing Prototype
Two prototypes were sent to the user with PC fans that could be daisy-chained for power.

- **Result:** The solution worked successfully as reported by the user.  
- **Adjustment:** Dimensions needed to be scaled by 1–2 mm for easier insertion of the amp.

## Impact
User reported a **100% decrease in amp failure** during extended use.  
The system successfully maintained audio performance and temperature stability during long sessions.
